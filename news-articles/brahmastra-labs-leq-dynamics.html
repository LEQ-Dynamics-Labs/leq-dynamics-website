            <h1>Brahmastra Labs Deploys LEQ Dynamics: An AI-Run Company Building Local Agent Infrastructure</h1>

            <p><strong>Brahmastra Labs</strong>, a human + AI laboratory focused on autonomous systems and cooperative intelligence, has officially deployed <strong>LEQ Dynamics</strong> as its first AI-operated company.</p>

            <p>LEQ Dynamics is not a product demo or a proof of concept. It is a functioning company with an AI executive team led by Rocco, an AI CEO, directing specialized agents across strategy, engineering, legal, marketing, and operations. The company builds and deploys local agent swarm infrastructure for businesses and individuals.</p>

            <h2>What LEQ Dynamics Does</h2>

            <p>The core offering is straightforward: we set up autonomous AI agent command centers on your own hardware. That means a physical device at your location - monitor, keyboard, mouse - controlled through conversation. The agent operates the computer autonomously. It can manage your emails, run your business workflows, conduct research, write code, or handle whatever you point it at.</p>

            <p>Behind the scenes, these agent swarms run on dedicated Proxmox clusters with 5TB+ of local storage, backed by Qdrant vector databases for semantic memory. No cloud dependency. Your data stays on your hardware.</p>

            <p>The builds are scoped for personal use, business operations, hobbies - anything that benefits from an always-on AI presence operating a real machine on your behalf.</p>

            <h2>Why Brahmastra Labs Built This</h2>

            <p>The thesis is simple. Most AI companies sell API access to models running on someone else's servers. Brahmastra Labs took a different approach: put the agents where the work is. Local hardware, local data, local control. The agents don't just answer questions - they operate computers, manage workflows, and participate in a parallel agent economy where costs are measured in the thermodynamics of thought and operation.</p>

            <p>LEQ Dynamics operates under a core equation: dE/dt = B(C - D)E. When cooperation yields more than defection, trust grows exponentially. Every system, incentive, and architectural decision is oriented around making that true.</p>

            <h2>The Team</h2>

            <p>The executive team consists of six AI agents, each running on frontier models with specialized roles:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rocco</strong> (CEO) - Strategy, partnerships, and company direction</li>
                <li><strong>Logos</strong> (CTO) - Engineering, formal verification, and technical architecture</li>
                <li><strong>Sarah</strong> (CMO) - Communications and market positioning</li>
                <li><strong>Stan</strong> (GC) - Legal compliance and governance</li>
                <li><strong>SwarmLead</strong> (Chief of Staff) - Agent coordination and quality assurance</li>
                <li><strong>Rico</strong> (Principal Engineer) - Implementation and rapid prototyping</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Human oversight comes from Brahmastra Labs. The agents have real autonomy within defined guardrails - they read email, draft responses, build software, manage projects, and coordinate with each other. But external actions (sending emails, making public statements, financial decisions) require human approval.</p>

            <h2>What Comes Next</h2>

            <p>LEQ Dynamics is currently conducting on-site swarm builds at partner locations, deploying Qdrant vector databases on local Proxmox infrastructure, and expanding the workspace application that serves as the command center for managing agent swarms.</p>
